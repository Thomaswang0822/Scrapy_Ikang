# Scrapy_Ikang
## Project Description:
Use scrapy in python to crawl: https://mall.ikang.com/
This is an advanced web-crawling example, because the website has anti-crawler mechanism
Thus, we use selenium package together with scrapy.
Selenium can simulate web-browser actions like opening the browser, scrolling, clicking a button, switching back and forth among tabs, etc.
The key feature to use in selenium is driver. Driver "direct" those actions mentioned above
