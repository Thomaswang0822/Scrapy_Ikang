# Scrapy_Ikang
## Project Description:
Use scrapy in python to crawl: https://mall.ikang.com/ <br />
This is an advanced web-crawling example, because the website has anti-crawler mechanism <br />
Thus, we use selenium package together with scrapy. <br />
Selenium can simulate web-browser actions like opening the browser, scrolling, clicking a button, switching back and forth among tabs, etc. <br />
The key feature to use in selenium is driver. Driver "directs" those actions mentioned above <br />
